===============================================================================
This is what is needed to be done to have a fully working deploy of the levels!
===============================================================================

1. We need to be able to parse and save a sheet without optimizing it. A "common"-pack including the
player spritesheets and all common sounds.

2. We need to extract all the common sounds from the sheet-xmls

3. We need to include the titlecards and all objects that spawn in the levelpacks!

4. We need to write a loader/parser for theese new levelpacks that:
	4a. Has good failsafe routines if a levelpack cannot be found. Go through a list of known hosts!
	4b. Parses the data (duh)
	4c. Stores common data in a persistant way, sounds AND assets


5. Exclude metadata-layer(?)
